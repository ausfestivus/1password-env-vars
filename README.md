# 1password-env-vars

A Bash script that will help you use 1password data to manage your Cloud provider CLI credentials.

First up, HT and thanks to [Grant Orchard](https://github.com/grantorchard) & [Anthony Burke](https://github.com/pandom). Grant because he wrote [this thing here](https://grantorchard.com/securing-environment-variables-with-1password/) which I was able to use to give me a head-start making this thing. Anthony because he introduced me to Grant's widget.

I've had a task in my personal project queue for a long time to write something like this. I was sick of having to manually key in my Cloud CLI credentials and chop and change them as I moved between various Cloud Platforms and tenancies.

## introduction

This script will accept a search string (enclosed in double-quotes) and list matching entries in your selected 1password vault.

```bash
ðŸ˜€ abest@BARMIX2:~ $ source ./.import_envvars.sh "Env Vars"
Enter the password for XXXX@XXXX.XXXX at XXXXXXXX.1password.com: 
Please select an entry:
1) Env Vars - AWS - Example
2) Env Vars - AWS - NAME0 - ENV
3) Env Vars - Azure - Company.com - Dev - SP
#?
```

You can then select the entry you want to insert the credentials for into your current CLI session.

```bash
ðŸ˜€ abest@BARMIX2:~ $ source ./.import_envvars.sh "Env Vars"
Enter the password for XXXX@XXXX.XXXX at XXXXXXXX.1password.com: 
Please select an entry:
1) Env Vars - AWS - Example
2) Env Vars - AWS - NAME0 - ENV
3) Env Vars - Azure - Company.com - Dev - SP
#? 2
Setting environment variable VAULT_ADDR
Setting environment variable AWS_REGION
Setting environment variable AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
Setting environment variable AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```
